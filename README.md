# Codius Astro

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── GitHubAuth.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## :wrench: Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For [`AUTH_SECRET`](https://github.com/nowaythatworked/auth-astro?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-environment-variables) in `.env`:

>Generate an auth secret by running `openssl rand -hex 32` in a local terminal or by visiting [generate-secret.vercel.app](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32), copy the string, then set it as the `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable describe below.

For `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`, you'll need to [create a GitHub OAuth App](https://authjs.dev/guides/configuring-github#creating-an-oauth-app-in-github) with:
